/**
 * Extends all RawRepresentables (enums) which are also Decodable with decode implementation.
 *
 * I could not find a way to implicitly declare RawRepresentable conforming to Decodable, what would make all enums Decodable automatically.
 * Because of that for an enum to be compatible with Decodable operators it must be declared as implementing Decodable protocol.
